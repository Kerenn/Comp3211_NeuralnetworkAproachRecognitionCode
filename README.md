# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition with Neural Network(COMP3211)
Neural network aproach of our project. This project creates Deep Neural Network with 4 hidden layers 1 input set and outpu layer. hidden layers has 1500 nodes each to train and test against MNIST handwritten Digit datasets. Also uses Convulution Neural Networks to compare 2 hidden layer with 4 against MNIST dataset. 

## Getting Started

This project uses the Tensorflow Library in Python and uses Deep Neural Networks and Convolution Neural Networks

1. Tensorflow 1.0
2. Python 2.7

To install Tensorflow
```
pip install tensorflow
```
## Running the tests

To run the code
```
python deep-net.py
python convneuralnetwork.py
python recneuralnetwork.py
```

## Built With

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/docs) - The Deep Learning Library
